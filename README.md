### Overview

You may be familiar with the concept of a Manager Readme, but for those not: a manager's README explains the manager's philosophy, working style, and personal quirks to their team. I believe Roy Rapoport [started the practice](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.p) at Netflix in 2016, and since then it's become [quite common](https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes). This document, _my_ manager README, endeavors to explain those things with respect to me. Because I'm only just starting my first official management position, my views will probably change as I learn. But, I spent the last ten years reporting to managers, and reading and thinking about management, so I want to be transparent about the philosophy I'm starting with.

My view of our team's relationship with the company is that the company turns our work into money and resources, and we turn the company's money and resources into more work; an efficient machine. My philosophy on managers, then, is that managers are the interface between a team and the broader company. Specifically, their two jobs are to 1) help the company get things it needs from the team, and 2) help the team get things it needs from the company.

### Helping the Team Get What it Needs from the Company

I hope to do a lot for this team, but three main categories stand out
1. Help you use the company to grow your career
1. Get resources for your projects
1. Keep your workload comfortable

For the first, I will be asking all of you regularly about what you want out of your career and trying to get that for you, or else encouraging you to think about this more if you haven't already. I view this as one of the most important parts of 1:1s. My goal is for everyone to feel like they're growing by working here.

The second and the third are closely related. The second refers to internal resources like information, meetings, and decisions, as well as external resources like software licenses and subscriptions, books and courses, conference tickets, connections with outside experts, etc. If the company, or anyone at the company, has access to any of these and they would help, I can go try and get them. The third refers specifically to time; I want to create time for us to finish projects without working long hours by keeping the list of projects short and cancelling projects that shouldn't be on it[^1]. I'm excited to try out story points, but I see balancing our obligations to the company with protecting our backlog as part of my job, to be done one way or another.

### Helping the Company Get What it Needs from the Team

Similar to the above, my responsibilities to the company fall into three main categories, in my view:
1. Be as honest and upfront as possible about our time and money costs; be a responsible steward of the company's money (which our salaries consume)
1. Mitigate risk
1. Maintain good teamwork

The first two relate to engineering estimates; arguably "1) give accurate estimates and 2) meet them," though we all know it's not quite that simple. Software engineering estimates are notoriously unreliable, but I believe that projects mostly go off the rails because of unaccounted technical or product risks, and scope creep caused by those risks. Therefore my perennial questions to the team will be "what can we confirm in the next milestone?". The Integrations team has always taken an experimental, confirmation-driven approach, and for our initiatives I expect us to throw away a lot of prototypes early in our schedules. And because not all risks can be accounted (we don't know everything and our rationality is bounded) I expect us to set a lot of checkpoints for ourselves. When projects aren't working, I can go to the company and warn them early.

The third is perhaps the most important single responsibility of a manager, and it's the one that I'm most excited about. At all times, everybody on the team should know what the goal is, the plan for accomplishing it, everybody's position on the field, and how each position contributes.

I put "good teamwork" in this bucket because if the team is disorganized we can't deliver, but good teamwork serves us too. Because we all have the same goal (unlike, say, most grad students) everybody will understand each other's work, but because everybody is in a different position, each can give unique feedback on how to improve. Great teamwork is rare, but I've experienced it, and when it happens it's transcendent. Everybody will improve more and faster as an engineer than they could on their own. By extension, don't only seek feedback from me; I can explain the company's engineering ladder and try to get you new or bigger responsibilities from the company, but figuring out how to do the best work possible is everyone's purview. I will certainly seek and welcome personal and team-wide feedback from everyone else.

Finally, in the vein of feedback: I spent the beginning of my career very worried about whether I was doing an adequate job. I liked [Roy Rapoport's framing of the issue](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.p), and I want to reassure everyone that I would seek total transparency if any performance issues arose. I'm always happy to reassure anyone who's worried about where they stand. Good feedback is the product of [psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/), so my goal is to arm everyone with confidence.

[^1]: I had a very formative experience with this early in my career, where my time was totally consumed with ad-hoc requests and I wound up working a totally unsustainable schedule and doing a bad job while I was at it. Only when my TL figured this out did my job get any better. Avery Pennarun wrote a [really great blog post about this specifically](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201712), and there's a [somewhat fanciful but very compelling reddit story](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rkk9qg/im_a_new_supervisor_and_my_direct_reports_are/hpacf5h/) to this end too.
