### Overview

You may be familiar with the concept of a Manager README, but for those not: a manager's README explains the manager's philosophy, working style, and personal quirks to their team. I believe Roy Rapoport [started the practice](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.p) at Netflix in 2016, and since then it's become [quite common](https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes). This document, _my_ manager README, endeavors to explain those things with respect to me[^0].

My view of our team's relationship with the company is that the company turns our work into money and resources, and we turn the company's money and resources into more work; an efficient machine. My philosophy on managers, then, is that managers are the interface between a team and the broader company. Specifically, their two jobs are to 1) help the company get things it needs from the team, and 2) help the team get things it needs from the company.

### Helping the Team Get What it Needs from the Company

I hope to do a lot for this team, but three main categories stand out:
1. Help you use the company to grow your career
1. Get resources for your projects
1. Keep the backlog consistent and comfortable

For the first, I will be asking all of you regularly about what you want out of your career and trying to get that for you, or else encouraging you to think about this more if you haven't already. I view this as one of the most important parts of 1:1s. I want everyone to feel like they're growing by working here.

The second and the third are closely related. The second refers to internal resources like information, meetings, and decisions, as well as external resources like software licenses and subscriptions, books and courses, conference tickets, connections with outside experts, etc. If the company, or anyone at the company, has access to any of these and they would help, I can go try and get them. The third refers specifically to time; engineers need to finish projects both to advance and to achieve a sense of purpose[^1]. I want to create time for us to finish projects without working long hours by keeping the list of projects short and consistent, and by cancelling projects that shouldn't be on it.

### Helping the Company Get What it Needs from the Team

Similar to the above, my responsibilities to the company fall into two main categories, in my view:
1. Be a responsible steward of the company's money (which our salaries consume)
1. Maintain good teamwork

As the company depends on us to turn its resources into work, the first could perhaps be restated "give accurate estimates and stick to them," though we all know it's not quite that simple. Part of the challenge is that many engineers (myself included) simply aren't that good at accounting all steps of a project, but [I'm excited to try out Story Points](story_points.md), which I hope will help. Another problem is that sometimes we simply don't have enough information to confidently plan a technical approach in the first place. Instead of guessing and hoping for the best, I want to push us to anticipate technical risks, and I want to support engineers building MVPs, demos, and spikes, even if the only deliverable is more confidence. Finally, some risks can't be anticipated; we don't know everything and our rationality is bounded. I plan to continue the Integrations team's experimental, confirmation-driven style and set a lot of checkpoints for ourselves. Expect to hear "what's the quickest way to get external feedback on this work?". When projects aren't hitting their milestones, I can go to the company and warn them early.

The second is perhaps the most important single responsibility of a manager, and it's the one that I'm most excited about. At all times, everybody on the team should know what the goal is, the plan for accomplishing it, everybody's [position on the field](ownership.md), and how each position contributes.

I put "good teamwork" in this bucket because we can't deliver if the team is disorganized, but good teamwork serves us too. Because we all have the same goal, everybody will understand each other's work (unlike, say, most grad students). But because everybody is in a different position, each can give unique feedback on how to improve. Great teamwork is hard to precipitate, but I've experienced it, and when it happens it's transcendent: everybody will improve more and faster as an engineer than they could on their own. By extension, don't only seek feedback from me; I can explain the company's engineering ladder and try to get you new or bigger responsibilities from the company, but figuring out how to do the best work possible is everyone's purview. I will certainly seek and welcome personal and team-wide feedback from everyone else.

Finally, in the vein of feedback: I spent the beginning of my career very worried about whether I was doing an adequate job. I want to reassure everyone that I would seek total transparency if any performance issues arose, and I'm always happy to reassure anyone who's worried about where they stand. Good feedback requires [psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/), so I want to arm everyone with confidence.

[^0]: Because I'm only just starting my first official management position, my views will probably change as I learn. But, I spent the last ten years reporting to managers, and reading and thinking about management, so I want to be transparent about the philosophy I'm starting with.

[^1]: I had a very formative experience with this early in my career. I inherited a deprecated but widely-used service, and its users' ad-hoc demands quickly consumed all of my time. I worked totally unsustainable hours trying to finish anything at all before the next emergency, and I mostly failed. I thought I was just a bad engineer, but my TL figured out what was happening and started pushing back on other teams, and my job and confidence both got way better. Avery Pennarun wrote a [really great blog post about this specifically](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201712), and there's a [somewhat fanciful but very compelling reddit story](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rkk9qg/im_a_new_supervisor_and_my_direct_reports_are/hpacf5h/) to this end too.
