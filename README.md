### Overview

You may be familiar with the concept of a Manager README, but for those not: a manager's README explains the manager's philosophy, working style, and personal quirks to their team. I believe Roy Rapoport [started the practice](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.p) at Netflix in 2016, and since then it's become [quite common](https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes). This document, _my_ manager README, endeavors to explain those things with respect to me[^0].

My view of our team's relationship with the company is that the company turns our work into money and resources, and we turn the company's money and resources into more work; an efficient machine. And "work" here means: make successful software. That's how we'll evaluate ourselves as a team.

My philosophy on engineering managers, then, is that they're responsible for the second part of this machine, and specifically for getting a good plan for making successful software and defending that plan until it's done. Whole sections of bookstores are dedicated to what characterizes "a good plan", but I see two essential parts: 1) make sure the engineers on our team are getting what they need from the company, and 2) make sure the team is producing work for the company commensurately with its resources.

### Getting What We Need from the Company

I hope to do a lot for this team, but three main categories stand out:
1. Help you use the company to grow your career
1. Get resources for your projects
1. Keep the backlog manageable

For the first, I plan to ask all of you regularly what you want in your career so I can try to get that for you. If you don't know, I plan to lay out some options and ask for your consideration. I view this as one of the most important parts of 1:1s, and I want everyone to feel like they're growing by working here.

The second and the third are closely related. The second refers to internal resources like information, meetings, and decisions, as well as external resources like software licenses and subscriptions, books and courses, conference tickets, connections with outside experts, etc. If the company, or anyone at the company, has access to any of these and they would help, I can go try and get them. The third refers specifically to time; engineers need to finish projects both to advance and to achieve a sense of purpose[^1]. I want to create time for us to finish projects without working long hours by keeping the list of projects short and consistent, and by cancelling projects that shouldn't be on it.

### Producing for the Company

The rest of the company does depend on us to turn its money into work. The more of this we can do for the company, the more the company can do for us. To this end, my responsibilities fall into two main categories, in my view:
1. Reducing risk:
    - **We plan to finish projects way ahead of when they're needed.** Some risks can't be anticipated: we possess bounded cognition and finite information. This way, when our plan breaks down for reasons we didn't see coming, we have some warning.
    - **We build lots of prototypes early and seek external validation.** I want to apply an enlightened understanding of technical risk (does this design work?) and product risk (will people like it?), and I want to support engineers building MVPs, demos, and spikes, even if the only deliverable is more confidence.  I plan to continue the Integrations team's experimental, confirmation-driven style, and I expect us to always follow the quickest path to empirical validation. Again, when projects miss their validation targets, we'll have some warning.
2. Maintaining good teamwork, and specifically, establishing unambiguous, transparent [ownership](ownership.md) of each decision.
    - Perhaps the most important single responsibility of a manager, and it's the one that I'm most excited about. Everybody on the team should know what the goal is, the plan for accomplishing it, everybody's position on the field, and how each position contributes.

Finally, I put "good teamwork" in the Company bucket because we can't deliver if the team is disorganized, but really, good teamwork serves us too, and connects the two sides of my job. Because we all have the same goal, everybody will understand each other's work (unlike, say, most grad students). But because everybody is in a different position and has a different perspective, each can give unique feedback on how to improve as a team. Great teamwork is hard to precipitate, but I've experienced it, and when you do, it's transcendent. On a great team, everybody improves more, and faster, as an engineer than they ever could on their own. By extension, don't only seek feedback from me; I can explain the company's engineering ladder and try to get you new or bigger responsibilities from the company, but figuring out how to do the best work possible is everyone's purview. I will certainly seek and welcome personal and team-wide feedback from everyone else.

Finally, in the vein of feedback: I spent the beginning of my career very worried about whether I was doing an adequate job. I want to reassure everyone that I would seek total transparency if any performance issues arose, and I'm always happy to reassure anyone who's worried about where they stand. Good feedback requires [psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/), so I want to arm everyone with confidence.

[^0]: Because I'm only just starting my first official management position, my views will probably change as I learn. But, I spent the last ten years reporting to managers, and reading and thinking about management, so I have some ideas that I'm excited to start with.

[^1]: I had a very formative experience with this early in my career. I inherited a deprecated but widely-used service, and its users' ad-hoc demands quickly consumed all of my time. I worked totally unsustainable hours trying to finish anything at all before the next emergency, and I mostly failed, and users were always mad about stuff not getting done. I thought I was just a bad engineer, but eventually I got a new TL who figured out what was happening and started pushing back on those users, and my job and confidence both got way better. Avery Pennarun wrote a [really great blog post about this specifically](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201712), and there's a [somewhat fanciful but very compelling reddit story](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rkk9qg/im_a_new_supervisor_and_my_direct_reports_are/hpacf5h/) to this end too.
